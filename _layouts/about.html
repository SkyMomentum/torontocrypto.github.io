            <em>"Operations security (OPSEC) is a term originating in U.S. military jargon, as a process that identifies critical information to determine if friendly actions can be observed by adversary intelligence systems, determines if information obtained by adversaries could be interpreted to be useful to them, and then executes selected measures that eliminate or reduce adversary exploitation of friendly critical information."</em>

          <p>First formed in 2012 in response to the growing concerns of privacy invasion and general security misconfigurations, Toronto Crypto initiated as an advocacy to bridge gaps in communication between parties of various skill-sets.</p>

          <p>We all have seen, too often, just how progressive privacy and information security debates can degrade in to a rhetorical political debate. Thus, Toronto Crypto was created as a non-partisan collective aiming to connect intellectuals from any, or none, of the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>We believe that Operations Security is an extremely important, and understated, facet of modern life.</p>
