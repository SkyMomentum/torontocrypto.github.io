We're in the process of assembling our works
to write up better technical documentation
for encrypting communications. Some of our

* [Toronto Crypto's Secure Browsing Guide](https://torontocrypto.org/files/torontocrypto_secure_browsing_guide.pdf)
* [CryptoParty's Crypto Handbook (2014)](https://torontocrypto.org/files/cryptoparty_handbook.pdf)
