We've had a busy summer but it's not over yet! We've started a [wiki documentation project](http://wiki.torontocrypto.org/index.php?title=Toronto_Crypto_Wiki) to help people learn about online privacy and how to safeguard their personal information.

## So why are we doing this?

At times people join us in our IRC channel with questions but sometimes don't even know where to start. Online privacy is a huge topic which can be overwhelming for newcomers, especially if they feel overwhelmed with the amount
of privacy information out there.

Staying safe online does not require an engineering degree or a council of wizards. It starts with being mindful about what you're doing online, and knowing how websites collect and use your information. From there learning how to apply the use of simple tools, like [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) or [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/). The goal of our wiki project is to share information in a more accessible way so that everyone can learn new skills and feel empowered to protect themselves.

With that, we bring you our first article: [Dating site privacy](http://wiki.torontocrypto.org/index.php?title=Dating_site_privacy). We think this is very timely as the [Ashley Madison hack continues to wreak havoc](http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/ashley-madison-aftermath-confessions-suicide-reports-and-hot-on-the-hackers-trail) and with the amount of attention this scenario has received world-wide, we can assume that similar issues will arise.

[Let us know](https://encrypt.to/0xF7C7BFE3) if you have questions or article ideas. We welcome your feedback!
