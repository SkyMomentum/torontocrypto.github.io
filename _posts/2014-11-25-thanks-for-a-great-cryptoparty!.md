Thanks for a great CryptoParty!

Sunday, November 23rd we hosted our
most recent CryptoParty at Hacklab Toronto and
we couldn't have been more pleased at how it
turned out! 

The slides can be downloaded here:

* [Using the Tor Browser Bundle](../files/Toronto_Cryptoparty_Tor_Browser.pdf)
* [Mobile Security and Privacy](../files/Toronto_Cryptoparty_Mobile_Privacy.pdf)
* [TLS: Today's Lite Security](../files/Toronto_Cryptoparty_TLS_TodaysLiteSecurity.pdf)

Thanks to everyone who made it out. We absolutely
appreciate all the feedback you gave and if
you're looking to give some more, feel free to

We will be seeing you at the next!
