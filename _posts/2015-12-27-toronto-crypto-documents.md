White papers and research documents online

We're in the process of assembling our works
to write up better technical documentation
for encrypting communications. Some of our
older works can be found here:

* [Toronto Crypto's Secure Browsing Guide](../files/torontocrypto_secure_browsing_guide.pdf)
* [CryptoParty's Crypto Handbook (2014)](../files/cryptoparty_handbook.pdf)

These will also exist in our new [Media section]
(/media). Stay tuned for further additions!
