Thanks for a great CryptoParty!

Sunday, November 23rd we hosted our
most recent CryptoParty at Hacklab Toronto and
we couldn't have been more pleased at how it
turned out! 

The following topics were covered:
- Online Marketing and how it tracks you

- Using the Tor Browser Bundle

- Mobile Security and Privacy

- TLS: Today's Lite Security

Thanks to everyone who made it out. We absolutely
appreciate all the feedback you gave and if
you're looking to give some more, feel free to
email us here.

We will be seeing you at the next!
